# genesiscloud_instance_status (Resource)

InstanceStatus resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "genesiscloud_instance" "example" {
  name   = "example"
  region = "NORD-NO-KRS-1"

  image = "ubuntu:22.04"
  type  = "vcpu-2_memory-4g"

  ssh_key_ids = [
    "my-ssh-key-id"
  ]
}


resource "genesiscloud_instance_status" "example" {
  instance_id = genesiscloud_instance.example.id
  status      = "active"
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `instance_id` (String) The id of the instance this refers to.
  - If the value of this attribute changes, the resource will be replaced.
- `status` (String) The target instance status.
  - The value must be one of: ["active" "stopped"].

### Optional

- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).

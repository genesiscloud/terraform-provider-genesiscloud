# genesiscloud_snapshot (Resource)

Snapshot resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "genesiscloud_instance" "target" {
  # ...
}

resource "genesiscloud_snapshot" "example" {
  name        = "example"
  instance_id = genesiscloud_instance.target.id

  retain_on_delete = true # optional
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `instance_id` (String) The id of the instance to snapshot.
  - If the value of this attribute changes, Terraform will destroy and recreate the resource.
- `name` (String) The human-readable name for the snapshot.

### Optional

- `retain_on_delete` (Boolean) Flag to retain the snapshot when the resource is deleted.
  - Sets the default value "false" if the attribute is not set.
- `timeouts` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--timeouts))

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) The timestamp when this snapshot was created in RFC 3339.
- `id` (String) The unique ID of the snapshot.
- `region` (String) The region identifier.
- `size` (Number) The storage size of this snapshot given in GiB.
- `status` (String) The snapshot status.

<a id="nestedatt--timeouts"></a>
### Nested Schema for `timeouts`

Optional:

- `create` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
- `delete` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Setting a timeout for a Delete operation is only applicable if changes are saved into state before the destroy operation occurs.
- `read` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours). Read operations occur during any refresh or planning operation when refresh is enabled.
- `update` (String) A string that can be [parsed as a duration](https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration) consisting of numbers and unit suffixes, such as "30s" or "2h45m". Valid time units are "s" (seconds), "m" (minutes), "h" (hours).
